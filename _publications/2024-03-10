title: "Indirect Peer Effects"

excerpt: "Manski (1993) identifies three potential sources of correlation between peer behavior and individual behavior: endogenous peer effects, contextual peer effects, and correlated effects. Despite the importance of distinguishing among these mechanisms, empirical studies often face significant challenges in separating endogenous peer effects from contextual ones due to data limitations and methodological complexities. In this paper, we build on the framework of Marchand (2020) and leverage unique cell-level data from a U.S. jail to address this issue. Specifically, we construct exposure variables based on the pre-treatment characteristics of both peers and their second-degree connections (peers of peers), allowing us to decompose direct peer effects from indirect peer effects, the latter aligning with endogenous peer effects as defined in Marchand’s model.

Our study departs from Marchand’s approach by employing a linear-in-mean model to analyze peer effects within this novel context. We find robust evidence of both direct and indirect peer effects, with these effects exhibiting comparable magnitudes. Notably, our results are statistically significant and demonstrate that peer dynamics play a meaningful role in shaping individual outcomes within the jail environment.

These findings carry substantial implications for policymakers and correctional administrators. They suggest that decisions regarding the allocation of inmates and their movements within facilities should explicitly account for the influence of peer effects to better manage behavioral outcomes and optimize institutional operations. By advancing our understanding of peer dynamics in a high-stakes setting, this study contributes to the broader literature on peer effects and offers practical insights for improving correctional policy."
