title: "Indirect Peer Effects"

excerpt: "Manski (1993) identifies three primary sources of correlation between peer behavior and individual behavior: endogenous peer effects, contextual peer effects, and correlated effects. While distinguishing among these mechanisms is critical for understanding peer influence, empirical studies often struggle to separate endogenous peer effects from contextual ones due to data limitations and methodological challenges. This paper builds on the framework of Marchand (2020) and leverages unique cell-level data from a U.S. jail to address this issue. By constructing exposure variables based on the pre-treatment characteristics of both peers and their second-degree connections (peers of peers), we disentangle direct peer effects from indirect peer effects, the latter corresponding to endogenous peer effects in Marchand’s model.

Our approach diverges from Marchand’s by employing a linear-in-mean model to analyze peer effects in this unique context. We find compelling evidence of both direct and indirect peer effects on recidivism, with these effects displaying comparable magnitudes. Importantly, our results are statistically significant, highlighting the critical role of peer dynamics in shaping individual behavior within the jail environment.

These findings have meaningful implications for policymakers and correctional administrators. They suggest that decisions regarding inmate allocation and movement within facilities should explicitly consider the impact of prior peer interactions to more effectively manage recidivism. By shedding light on the nuanced dynamics of peer effects in a high-stakes setting, this study contributes to the broader literature on social interactions and provides actionable insights for improving correctional policy."
