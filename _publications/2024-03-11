title: "Timing Matters: Exploring the Temporal Dynamics of Peer Effects in Jail"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: "Are initial interactions more influential than subsequent ones? This question remains underexplored in the literature on peer effects, where timing may play a critical role in shaping individual outcomes. In this project, we leverage detailed cell-level data from a U.S. jail to extend the theoretical model developed by Boucher et al. (2024), explicitly incorporating the temporal dimension of peer interactions. By doing so, we aim to shed light on whether the sequence and timing of interactions matter for peer influence.

The linear-in-mean model has long served as a foundational framework in empirical research on peer effects. Substantial theoretical and empirical evidence highlights the significant influence of peers on various outcomes, including criminal behavior, educational performance, and prosocial actions. However, the assumption that the mean captures the entirety of peer effects has been increasingly questioned. Boucher et al. (2024) address this limitation by proposing a flexible theoretical model paired with structural estimation to identify the optimal functional form for modeling peer effects. Their work provides a critical step forward in the field but does not consider the potential role of timing in the dynamics of peer interactions.
This omission is particularly important in contexts where sequential interactions might matterâ€”such as in correctional facilities, where individuals are exposed to peers over varying periods and under different conditions. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by examining how the timing of interactions influences outcomes and whether early interactions carry more weight than those occurring later. By incorporating this temporal dimension into Boucher et al.'s framework, we offer new insights into the dynamics of peer effects, with implications for both theory and policy."
