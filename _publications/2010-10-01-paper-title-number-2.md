excerpt: "<p style='text-align: justify;'> This paper examines the impact of peer effects on recidivism using detailed cell-level data from a U.S. jail. While a growing body of literature explores peer influence in correctional facilities, many studies rely on standard linear-in-means models that average pre-treatment characteristics; for example, an individual’s likelihood of criminal activity may be influenced by the average criminal activity within their neighborhood. Our study advances this work by investigating the specific stages and functions of inmate interactions that most strongly influence future criminal behavior. Leveraging the lack of systematic cell allocation, we construct exposure measures at the cell level based on inmates’ criminal histories, including the total number and severity (severity index) of prior convictions. To assess both the timing and nature of interactions that impact recidivism, we develop exposure measures for peer influence during the initial and final days of incarceration (timing aspect) and capture the characteristics of the “worst” peer, as well as the mean and sum of prior convictions and severity index (functional form aspect). Our findings reveal that initial interactions—those occurring upon jail entry—have a more pronounced effect on recidivism than later interactions, with the strongest predictors being the average peer severity and influence from the “worst” peer, identified by our severity index. These results suggest that strategic allocation of inmates at intake could play a crucial role in reducing recidivism by accounting for the influential role of initial peer interactions, providing valuable guidance for policymakers. </p>"
