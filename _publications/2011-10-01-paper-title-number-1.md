excerpt: 'In this paper, I provide empirical evidence on how inmate allocation within prisons influences post-release criminal behavior in Chile. Employing a sharp regression discontinuity design, I show that first-time offenders placed with peers who are more actively involved in criminal activities are almost twice as likely to be re-incarcerated after release. Leveraging the unique Chilean context, I explore four potential channels influencing post-release behavior: job market stigma, prison facilities, peer dynamics, and peer influence on participation in rehabilitation programs. Descriptive analysis suggests that while job market stigma and prison infrastructure have limited impact, the main findings are likely driven by peer effects and the role of peer dynamics in decisions to participate in rehabilitation programs. Furthermore, peer effects appear to be more substantial among individuals with higher criminal profiles. This finding implies that mixing inmates with diverse criminal profiles may be a potential strategy to reduce overall recidivism. These results carry significant implications for policymakers and stakeholders striving to lower recidivism rates via improved strategies in prison allocation.'
